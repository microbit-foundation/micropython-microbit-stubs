Ideally this function should be called a single time, before any data is
logged, to configure the data table header once.

If a log file already exists when the program starts, or if this function
is called multiple times, it will check the labels already defined in the
log file. If this function call contains any new labels not already
present, it will generate a new header row with the additional columns.

By default the first column contains a timestamp for each row. The time
unit can be selected via the timestamp argument.

:param *labels: Any number of positional arguments, each corresponding to an entry in the log header.
:param timestamp: (時間戳記) Select the timestamp unit that will be automatically added as the first column in every row. Timestamp values can be one of ``log.MILLISECONDS``, ``log.SECONDS``, ``log.MINUTES``, ``log.HOURS``, ``log.DAYS`` or ``None`` to disable the timestamp. The default value is ``log.SECONDS``."""
