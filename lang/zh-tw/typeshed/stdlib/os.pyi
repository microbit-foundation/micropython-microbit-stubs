The return value is an object with five attributes:

- ``release`` - operating system release
- ``version`` - operating system version
- ``machine`` - hardware identifier

There is no underlying operating system in MicroPython. As a result the
information returned by the ``uname`` function is mostly useful for
versioning details."""
