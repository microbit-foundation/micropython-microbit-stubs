Normally, a collection is triggered only when a new allocation
cannot be satisfied, i.e. on an  out-of-memory (OOM) condition.
If this function is called, in addition to OOM, a collection
will be triggered each time after ``amount`` bytes have been
allocated (in total, since the previous time such an amount of bytes
have been allocated). ``amount`` is usually specified as less than the
full heap size, with the intention to trigger a collection earlier than when the
heap becomes exhausted, and in the hope that an early collection will prevent
excessive memory fragmentation. This is a heuristic measure, the effect
of which will vary from application to application, as well as
the optimal value of the ``amount`` parameter.

A value of -1 means a disabled allocation threshold.

This function is a MicroPython extension. CPython has a similar
function - ``set_threshold()``, but due to different GC
implementations, its signature and semantics are different.
