# The structure of this file is as follows:
# - Blank lines and comments starting with `#` are ignored.
# - Lines contain the name of a module, followed by a colon,
#   a space, and a version range (for example: `symbol: 2.7-3.9`).
#
# Version ranges may be of the form "X.Y-A.B" or "X.Y-". The
# first form means that a module was introduced in version X.Y and last
# available in version A.B. The second form means that the module was
# introduced in version X.Y and is still available in the latest
# version of Python.
#
# If a submodule is not listed separately, it has the same lifetime as
# its parent module.
#
# Python versions before 2.7 are ignored, so any module that was already
# present in 2.7 will have "2.7" as its minimum version. Version ranges
# for unsupported versions of Python 3 (currently 3.5 and lower) are
# generally accurate but we do not guarantee their correctness.
