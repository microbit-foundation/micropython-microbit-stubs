        To support RGBW neopixels, a third argument can be passed to
        ``NeoPixel`` to indicate the number of bytes per pixel (``bpp``).
        For RGBW, this is is 4 rather than the default of 3 for RGB and GRB.

        Each pixel is addressed by a position (starting from 0). Neopixels are
        given RGB (red, green, blue) / RGBW (red, green, blue, white) values
        between 0-255 as a tuple. For example, in RGB, ``(255,255,255)`` is
        white. In RGBW, ``(255,255,255,0)`` or ``(0,0,0,255)`` is white.
