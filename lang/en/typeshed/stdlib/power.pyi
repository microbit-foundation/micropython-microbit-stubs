    If no wake up sources have been configured it will sleep until the reset button is pressed (which resets the Target MCU) or, in battery power, when the USB cable is inserted.

    When the ``run_every`` parameter is set to ``True`` (the default), any function scheduled with ``microbit.run_every`` will still run while the board sleeps. When the scheduled time is reached the micro:bit will momentarily wake up to run the scheduled function and then automatically go back to sleep.
