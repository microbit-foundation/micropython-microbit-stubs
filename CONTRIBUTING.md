Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only
possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed on GitHub:

https://github.com/microbit-foundation/micropython-microbit-stubs

If you find a problem with these stubs then please file an issue to discuss it.
If possible please include Python code (as text, not a screenshot) that
demonstrates the issue. If a tool gave you an unexpected error message when
using these stubs them please include it along with the name and version of the
tool.

Pull requests are welcome. We'll need to ensure that changes work well with
the micro:bit Python Editor and, if they affect translated text, that they
don't cause an amount re-translation work that's disproportionate to the
benefit of the change.

The project uses [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to format
Python code so please check out their documentation and set it up with your
code editor.
