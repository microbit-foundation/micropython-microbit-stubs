## micro:bit MicroPython stubs for editor support

### Credit and licensing

builtins and utility definitions are derived from [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed). Further work is required to review these to ensure that we don't have stubs for definitions MicroPython does not support. These stubs don't provide documentation.

MicroPython and micro:bit stubs are based on the restructured text documentation for [micro:bit](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/tree/v2-docs) and where not otherwise covered in micro:bit-specific docs, [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/docs/library). These stubs provide documentation.
