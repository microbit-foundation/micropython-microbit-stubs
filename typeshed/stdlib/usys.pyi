For MicroPython, it has following attributes:

- ``version`` - tuple (major, minor, micro), e.g. (1, 7, 0)

This object is the recommended way to distinguish MicroPython from other
Python implementations (note that it still may not exist in the very
minimal ports).

CPython mandates more attributes for this object, but the actual useful
bare minimum is implemented in MicroPython.

Maximum value which a native integer type can hold on the current platform,
or maximum value representable by MicroPython integer type, if it's smaller
than platform max value (that is the case for MicroPython ports without
long int support).

This attribute is useful for detecting "bitness" of a platform (32-bit vs
64-bit, etc.). It's recommended to not compare this attribute to some
value directly, but instead count number of bits in it::

    bits = 0
    v = sys.maxsize
    while v:
        bits += 1
        v >>= 1

        # "> 32", "> 64" style of comparisons.

the original MicroPython reference board. It thus can be used to
distinguish one board from another.

Python implementation), use `sys.implementation` instead.
