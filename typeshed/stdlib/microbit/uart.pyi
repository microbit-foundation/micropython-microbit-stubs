    :param stop: The number of stop bits, has to be 1 for micro:bit.

    Initializing the UART on external pins will cause the Python console on
    USB to become unaccessible, as it uses the same hardware. To bring the
    console back you must reinitialize the UART without passing anything for
    ``tx`` or ``rx`` (or passing ``None`` to these arguments).  This means
    that calling ``uart.init(115200)`` is enough to restore the Python console.

    For more details see `the online documentation <https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v2-docs/uart.html>`_.
