    Offset ticks value by a given number, which can be either positive or

    Given a ticks value, this function allows to calculate ticks
    value delta ticks before or after it, following modular-arithmetic
    definition of tick values.

    :param ticks: A ticks value
    :param delta: An integer offset

    Example::

        # Find out what ticks value there was 100ms ago

def ticks_diff(ticks1: int, ticks2: int) -> int:
    """
    Measure ticks difference between values returned from
    ``utime.ticks_ms()`` or ``ticks_us()``, as a signed value
    which may wrap around.

    Example: ``utime.ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now)``

    :param ticks1: The value to subtract from
    :param ticks2: The value to subtract

    The argument order is the same as for subtraction operator,
    ``ticks_diff(ticks1, ticks2)`` has the same meaning as ``ticks1 - ticks2``.

    ``ticks_diff()`` is designed to accommodate various usage
    patterns, among them:

    Polling with timeout. In this case, the order of events is known, and you
    will deal only with positive results of :func:`utime.ticks_diff()`::

        # Wait for GPIO pin to be asserted, but at most 500us
        start = time.ticks_us()
        while pin.value() == 0:
            if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_us(), start) > 500:
                raise TimeoutError


    Scheduling events. In this case, :func:`utime.ticks_diff()` result may be
    negative if an event is overdue::

        # This code snippet is not optimized
        now = time.ticks_ms()
        scheduled_time = task.scheduled_time()
        if ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) > 0:
            print("Too early, let's nap")
            sleep_ms(ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now))
            task.run()
        elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) == 0:
            print("Right at time!")
            task.run()
        elif ticks_diff(scheduled_time, now) < 0:
            print("Oops, running late, tell task to run faster!")
            task.run(run_faster=true)
