    The default configuration is suitable for most use.

    :param length: (default=32) defines the maximum length, in bytes, of a
    message sent via the radio. It can be up to 251 bytes long (254 - 3 bytes
    for S0, LENGTH and S1 preamble).

    :param queue: (default=3) specifies the number of messages that can be
    stored on the incoming message queue. If there are no spaces left on the
    queue for incoming messages, then the incoming message is dropped.

    :param channel: (default=7) an integer value from 0 to 83
    (inclusive) that defines an arbitrary "channel" to which the radio is
    tuned. Messages will be sent via this channel and only messages received
    via this channel will be put onto the incoming message queue. Each step is
    1MHz wide, based at 2400MHz.

    :param power: (default=6) is an integer value from 0 to 7 (inclusive) to
    indicate the strength of signal used when broadcasting a message. The
    higher the value the stronger the signal, but the more power is consumed
    by the device. The numbering translates to positions in the following list
    of dBm (decibel milliwatt) values: -30, -20, -16, -12, -8, -4, 0, 4.

    :param address: (default=0x75626974) an arbitrary name, expressed as a
    32-bit address, that's used to filter incoming packets at the hardware
    level, keeping only those that match the address you set. The default used
    by other micro:bit related platforms is the default setting used here.

    :param group: (default=0) an 8-bit value (0-255) used with the
    ``address`` when filtering messages. Conceptually, "address" is like a
    house/office address and "group" is like the person at that address to
    which you want to send your message.

    :param data_rate: (default=radio.RATE_1MBIT) indicates the speed at which
    data throughput takes place. Can be one of the following constants defined
    in the ``radio`` module:
    ``RATE_250KBIT``, ``RATE_1MBIT`` or ``RATE_2MBIT``.
