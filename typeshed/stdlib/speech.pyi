"""This module makes the micro:bit talk, sing and make other speech like sounds.
By default sound output will be via the edge connector on pin 0 and the
:doc:`built-in speaker <speaker>` **V2**. You can connect wired headphones or
a speaker to pin 0 and GND on the edge connector to hear the sound:

.. note::

    This work is based upon the amazing reverse engineering efforts of
    Sebastian Macke based upon an old text-to-speech (TTS) program called SAM
    (Software Automated Mouth) originally released in 1982 for the
    Commodore 64. The result is a small C library that we have adopted and
    adapted for the micro:bit. You can find out more from
    `his homepage <http://simulationcorner.net/index.php?page=sam>`_. Much of
    the information in this document was gleaned from the original user's
    manual which can be found
    `here <http://www.apple-iigs.info/newdoc/sam.pdf>`_.

The speech synthesiser can produce around 2.5 seconds worth of sound from up to
255 characters of textual input.

To access this module you need to::
