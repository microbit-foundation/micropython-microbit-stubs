## audio

AudioFrame.copyfrom is undocumented
AudioFrame implements some operations that aren't clearly documented (e.g. you can add them, multiple by an integer...)

## misc

In waveforms.py

frames = [ None ] * 32

is a problematic initialization pattern for arrays. Can we relax the rules?
Is the pattern widespread?
