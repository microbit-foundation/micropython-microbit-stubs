## audio

AudioFrame.copyfrom is undocumented
AudioFrame implements some operations that aren't clearly documented (e.g. you can add them, multiple by an integer...)
The current module doc isn't enough to really understand how to use the module.
There's more useful content in the rst doc.

## __init__

button.rst is good, the rest needs review
removed (see below) from button_a 

image - type of buffer in second __init__ option
text modified to split across __init__ definitions
"Same as" language is unhelpful.

microphone - the doc style here is a bit different to elsewhere, might be less good in Pyright?

## micropython

opt_level has @overload with split docs

micropython.schedule is missing from our docs. Why? It is on the device (checked on V2).

## music

lots of necessary docs omitted from module comment
would be no good in a hover or completion

## builtins

### open

Needs revisiting if we want the docs.
We support fewer options but would be good to look at the impl to determine which.
It looks like unknown keyword arguments are accepted without error.


## misc

In waveforms.py

frames = [ None ] * 32

is a problematic initialization pattern for arrays. Can we relax the rules?
Is the pattern widespread?

Are the pin types correct? To review. E.g. music.
